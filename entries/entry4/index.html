    <h6>The Wizard of Oz</h6>
      <h6> August 25, 1939</h6>
  <p>
    When a tornado rips through Kansas, Dorothy and her dog, Toto, are whisked away in their house to the magical land of Oz. They follow the Yellow Brick Road toward the Emerald City to meet the Wizard, and en route they meet a Scarecrow that needs a brain, a Tin Man missing a heart, and a Cowardly Lion who wants courage. The wizard asks the group to bring him the broom of the Wicked Witch of the West to earn his help.

      I was in kindergarten and it was my first day of school. All the teachers and kids were waiting on the blacktop waiting for the time to hit 8 oclock to head inside. All of a sudden, the sky gets dark and the autumn leaves start whirling around with the strong winds. All of my classmates and I get scared by the gray clouds approaching. The winds and clouds turned into a big tornado in the distance. As everyone panicked to go inside, I ran from the crowd and started heading down the street. I wanted to go to my grandma's house and since I was dropped off every single day, I knew the whole way with my eyes closed. I knew the path by heart, so I start running. However, no matter how fast I ran, the tornado was also right behind me. I run toward the end of the street and the narrow hill that we usually drive through turned into a huge enclosed slide. I rushed through the slide and escaped the tornado.

    I had this dream years ago, but it is still prominent in my memory. I decided to watch The Wizard of Oz after recalling my dream. It is similar because they both include tornados that cause the main character to go in a panic. In the Wizard of Oz, the main character is threatened by the tornado that causes her to go on a big journey to find her way back home. In my dream, I was threatened by the tornado that resulted on an adventure to my grandma's house. I think the movie relates perfectly to my dream.  </p>

    A Classic<br>
    This movie was a classic and a movie that sparked my creativity when I was younger. The special effects and wild adventures really increased my imagination. It also talks about the importance of friendship, to never give up, and the challeneges of adversity. It definitly is a movie that will never get old and it's for all ages!</p> </div>
