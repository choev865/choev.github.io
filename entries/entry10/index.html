I was sitting on my bed and two of my friends came up to me to talk about their art piece. They were both trying to persuade me into buying their work. My friend Mayala created a large acrylic painting that she spent hours on. She painted a portrait of a woman with various different colors. My other friend, George, created a large abstract painting with large strokes of colors that were influenced by the farm. They started to talk over each other and yelling at me on how I should buy their piece.

After I had my dream, I instantly knew I would write about this movie. The movie and my dream have a lot of similarities since two people are competing and persuading a person to buy their product or sell something. In the end of my dream, I don't choose either of them because I was so overwhelmed and in the movie, the boss decides not to hire either of them because of their immaturity.

    This movie was a classic Disney movie I watched when I was younger. I loved how the movie shows 3 different stories and perspectives because each friendship was different with different people. It taught me a lot about friendships, but it is definitely for younger audiences.
