 A natural talent in the sport of surfing, teenager Bethany Hamilton loses an arm in a shark attack. Bolstered by the love of her parents and refusing to give up, she plans to return to competition, although questions about her future continue to trouble her. Upon seeing the devastation in Thailand caused by the 2004 tsunami, Bethany discovers a greater purpose: to make a difference in the lives of others.  <p>

    <p>
I didn't have my drivers license, so I was practicing with my mom. I was behind the wheel and I couldn't control the car anymore. The car was moving in all different directions and we ended up crashing into a tree. My mom was furious and mad. Then, we fast forwarded to another time I was practicing my driving skills with my mom. I was driving to my grandma's house and we approached this downward hill. My mom was screaming "BRAKE!!," but no matter how hard I hit the brake pedal, I was not stopping. The car kept going and stopped 1 inch in front of the other car. I was scared and I did not want to drive again, but I got motivated because my test was coming soon and I could drive anywhere I wanted after.

For this week, I decided to choose Soul Surfer because I thought the themes matched very well. In the movie, Bethany goes through a terrible shark accident that changes how she lives forever. She overcomes the obstacle of not having an arm by trying to live a normal life again and going to therapy. She soon goes back into the ocean and surfs again. My dream is not as tragic, but I also go through an accident that makes me scared to drive again. I am traumatized and scared to drive with my mom. However, I keep practicing and drive around the neighborhood, so that I can pass my driver's test.

    Amazing and inspiring. The movie really impacted my life in a more positive way. Even though she lost a limb, she finds her way back into her normal world and does the things she loves most: surfing. I thought it was brave that she goes back into the ocean even though that's what caused the accident.
