    <h6>Dream</h6>
    <h6>September 24, 2022</h6>
    <p>
      I was sitting in my room and then I realized my whole marching band left to go perform. But I was like "oh, well I’m a senior and I don’t know the show or music anyway so I don’t have to go". I was nervouse, so I left anyway. I flew way above bars, restaurants, and houses to avoid being seen by the town. I had to hide my identity of being a fairy. I arrived at school anyway and my crush asked to go on a date with me. We walked around the restaurants again and we saw the marching band and the really bad cheer squad, so we laughed. Then we went into this woods area where people were and took pictures of the scenery.

  For this week, I decided to watch Spider-man: Homecoming after my dream. The two are similar because the main character in the movie and in my dream are both trying to hide their identity: Spiderman hero and fairy. The two main characters are also balancing their private lives in high school with their crushes and their secret identity.

    Favorite<br>
    This was one of my favorite marvel movies because it has comedy and actors that I loved like Zendaya and Tom Holland. This movie is very action-packed and I love that it has multiple parts.</p> </div>
