<p> Harmony was sitting in her room when she realized she was late for band practice. She stopped eating her snacks and quickly flew over restauarnts and bars to get to school. She was going to skip practice, but she wanted to talk to the cute boy in the marching band. Later she ended up talking to the boy and sneaking out of practice to go see the scenery at the nearby cliff.

    Favorite
    As someone that has watched this movie countless times, I will say it is engaging and inspiring. It is one of my all time favorite movies when I was little.

    Not my style
    This movie was boring and for little kids/teens. I also read the book and I can't believe how inaccurate it is.
