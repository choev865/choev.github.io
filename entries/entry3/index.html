    <h6>Elf</h6>
      <h6> November 7, 2003</h6>
  <p>
Buddy was accidentally transported to the North Pole as a toddler and raised to adulthood among Santa's elves. Unable to shake the feeling that he doesn't fit in, the adult Buddy travels to New York, in full elf uniform, in search of his real father. As it happens, this is Walter Hobbs, a cynical businessman. After a DNA test proves this, Walter reluctantly attempts to start a relationship with the childlike Buddy with increasingly chaotic results.  <p>

    <h6>Dream</h6>
    <h6>August 2022</h6>
    <p>
    I was going to go on a cruise with my family and my family friends. We got on the cruise, but some of the kids got lost and strayed from the parents, while touring the boat. All the kids were in the elevator and none of them could remember which floor they had to stop on. They all walked out onto a random floor that was covered in this teal carpet. The walls and ceiling were all covered in the teal carpet with crystal light fixtures on the side. The kids realized this was not their floor and they rushed to get on the nearest elevator and to their surprise there was only one button. The elevator started to shake and it suddenly turned into cable car. The kids were astonished as they flew over a festive little town covered in snow. The houses had christmas decorations up and reindeers were roaming around forests. They were in the North Pole. They talked with Santa Claus and the little elves in the factory until they got teleported back to the elevator cruise.

    I decided to choose the movie "Elf" because it had similar aspects to my dream. I remember watching this movie when I was younger and it related to my dream because the main characters are entering a new territory. In the movie, Buddy leaves the North Pole and goes to New York. He struggles with fitting in and with the new scenery. In my dream, my friends and I are confused with the sudden change of location at the North Pole. They both have the Christmas atmosphere at the North Pole and the aspect of being teleported into a foreign place. </p>

    Good Holiday Movie<br>
    This is one of the funniest holiday movies that I watched. I love the contrast between the animated parts of the beginning and the realistic, real-life scenes for the rest of the movie. </p> </div>
