    <h6>The Proposal</h6>
      <h6> June 19, 2009</h6>
  <p>
For three years, Andrew Paxton has had a hard time as the assistant to Margaret Tate, hard-driving editor at a New York publisher. When Margaret, a Canadian, faces deportation for an expired visa, she hatches a scheme to marry Andrew - he agrees if she'll promise a promotion. A skeptical immigration agent vows to test the couple about each other the next Monday. Andrew had plans to fly home that weekend for his grandma's 90th, so Margaret goes with him - to Sitka, Alaska - where mom, dad, and grams await. Margaret and Andrew must stick to their wedding plan despite numerous mishaps.  <p>

    <h6>Dream</h6>
    <h6>July 2022</h6> <p>
In my dream, my mom wakes me up at 8am like I asked her to the night before. I was so tired so I stayed in bed. A couple minutes later, Mark, the guy from the cruise, walks into her room with a backpack. I was half asleep as Mark starts confessing his love for me. He takes out a half eaten apple, pickle, and sticks of butter out of his backpack to give to me. I stare at him half awake and reject kindly. He says this is all he can give me and I said I didn't need any of it. Then he pulled out a rose and kneed on my carpet. He said "Will you marry me." I was at a loss of words from the sudden confession, since I met him once on the cruise. I said "no" and frantically waved my hands in a way to express my emotions.

I thought the title of this movie matched perfectly with my dream. The main characters of the movie hate each other in the beginning, while they are stuck with a proposal connecting them together. In my dream, the proposal was the main part, but I rejected it because I did not know him well. I think the circumstances for the proposal are very similar because it is very ridiculous and unrealistic. Two coworkers who loather each other and two people that just met would never agree to get married together.

    Funny Romcom<br>
    I love romantic comedies and this was a masterpiece. The scenes were very funny and the two main characters have so much chemistry. It seemed cliche, but it was very entertaining and hilarious.
