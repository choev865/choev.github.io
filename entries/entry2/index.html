    <h6>Dream</h6>
    <h6>September 18 2022</h6>
    <p>
I receive a report and I head upstairs to the apartment with my police officer partner. I was scared because this was my first real case and report. On our way up, I see a nose and knife sticking out of wall. I assumed that it was a victim buried in the wall and notified the other officers. The call from earlier led them to a brown door and a woman answered the door. I made small talk with her and she let us in her house. I didn't want her to know we were gonna arrest her so I kept looking around the house and complimenting how neat and decorated the 
 place was. Then, as we walked towards the living room, the woman grabs a tissue and puts it in the candle. She shoves it into my face, but I grabbed her arm before it reached my face. The act was over. I tossed her to the ground and I duct taped her feet together. Before I could get to her hands, the woman grabbed her phone and started to text someone, "I swear someone's gonna kill me right now. I love 
 you so much awekfwig..." I quickly grabbed her phone and continued duct taping 
 her hands, while her partner prepared to take her downstairs. I told her, "Don't worry. You're not gonna die, you're going to jail."

After telling my friend about my dream, she told me it reminded her of the movie "Midnight Runners," so we watched it together. It was very similar because it was about police officers who started off scared and nervous, but they succeeded in overcoming their fear and catching a criminal. In my dream, I was a police officer and I was nervous as well, but I caught the criminal. They are both action packed and it made me feel stronger. I also thought my dream was funny like the movie because the dialouge was very absurd and the criminal was the SNL actress.

    My friend introduced me to this movie and I thought it went perfectly with my dream. It was a perfect mix of crime, action, and comedy. Even though it was a scary crime movie, the comedy scenes made me laugh a lot. I would recommend this to everyone who likes a little mystery and comedy!</p> </div>
