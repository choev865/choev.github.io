    <h6>Love, Rosie</h6>
      <h6> May 5, 2015</h6>
  <p>
 Rosie and Alex have been best friends since childhood. As high school ends, she's starting to recognize that there may be feelings besides friendship between them. But she doesn't get the chance to find out for sure, because he heads to Boston to study at Harvard, while she stays put in England, where an unplanned pregnancy puts a halt on her own college plans. As the years pass and other romantic partners move in and out of both their lives, Rosie must decide whether Alex is her soulmate -- and, if so, what should she do about it.  <p>

    <h6>Dream</h6>
    <h6>June 2022</h6>
    <p>
In my dream, I was sleeping and I woke up at noon. I bolted out of my bed and was surprised to see that I missed all my alarms. I was late for my job interview. My phone had a missed call from the person who contacted me and I panicked. I quickly ran to the bathroom and tried to get ready as fast as possible. My mom always woke me up, but today she didn't, so I yelled at her along the way. I quickly left the house and drove as fast as I could to the store. I entered and asked if I could still participate in the job interview and my boss said it was too late. She told me I should have been more responsible and to never come back again. I broke down in tears.

  For this week, I decided to re-watch Love, Rosie. I picked this movie because I was very late for my job interview and missed my opportunity to get hired. In the movie, Rosie and Alex keep missing their chances to be together. For example, Rosie read Alex's letter too late about his feelings. She rushed to tell him her feelings before his wedding, but arrived after the ceremony. This was the biggest missed opportunity throughout the movie, but in the end it worked out. I contrasted the movie and my dream because we were both late for very important events.

    <p>•••••<br>
    Favorite<br>
    This is my favorite rom-com movie of all time. I've rewatched this movie about 4 times already because I love the plot and characters that change throughout the span of 10+ years. It is definitely unrealistic, but it takes the audience through the ups and downs of relationships.
