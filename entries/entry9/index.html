    <h6>Dream</h6>
    <h6>November 2022</h6>
    <p>

  I was back at church as a SAT teacher. I used to teach during the summer of 2021, but it had a lot of negative and postives. The whole SAT camp was very unorganized, but I loved all the students and teachers that I worked with. I found myself walking through the doors again and the hallway was empty. I pass by each classroom hoping to see a face I know. I couldn't belive that I was back and was about to teach another class again. I saw a lot of new faces and other teachers who were way older than I was. I started to get nervous because I felt unqualified. Then I realized, I was in charge of the 6th grade English class. I panicked because I was not experienced or ready at all. All the emotions I felt last year were happening again, but this time I was unprepared on the first day of camp. I didn't have a lesson or any sort of activity prepared, but I was heading towards my classroom. I peek in and I had a class full of students waiting for me. They didn't take me seriously beause I was so young and I got more nervous because I was unprepared.

This week, the movie I chose was very different from my dream. However I thought they had one aspect that connected the two: being unprepared. Juno was unprepared to have the baby which made her have decisions about aborting. I was completely unprepared on my first day of teaching and panicked as I walk through the buiding.

    Masterpiece<br>
    This movie talks about teenage pregnancy and beautifully displays the hardships and situations Juno has to go through. It was not the average teenage pregnancy movie, but it was fun and unusal. It is a very wholesome movie that touches on the struggles of adoption, tennage pregnancy, abortion, and infertility.
