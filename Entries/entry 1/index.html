<h4>Detailed Plot</h4>
	Veronica's mom walks into her bedroom to wake her up at 8am. A couple minutes later, Mark, <br>the guy from the cruise, walks into her bedroom with a backpack. Veronica was half asleep as <br>Mark starts confessing his love for her. She stares confusingly as he starts unpacking random <br>objects such as a <mark>half eaten apple</mark>, pickle, and sticks of butter. He claims this is all he can afford <br>to give her and she refused and said she didn't need any of it. Then Mark pulled out a rose and kneeled<br>to the ground. He stated, "Veronica, will you <mark>marry me</mark>." She was at a loss of words from the sudden <br>confession and the rapid speed of their meeting.

<strong>Half Eaten Apple</strong>-indicates that whatever you are striving and aiming for may not be <br>		fulfilling, and even harmful to you; may also represent neglect and carelessness

<strong>Proposal</strong>-indicates that you are merging a previously unknown aspect of yourself; more <br>	directly, you are thinking about marriage or serious long-term commitments

		Great Movie
		This is my FAVORITE romcom I have ever seen. I have watched it so many times I memorized it! 

		<h4>John</h4>
		••◦◦◦
		Awful
		I have never seen a movie this bad. The plot was confusing and the proposal was so random.

		<h4>Sara</h4>
		••••◦
		Amazing
		I really like this movie because it gives a realistic ending with a little comedy. The scenes were very heartbreaking, but funny at the same time.
